## 20190307 | Release 0.10.0

Today we release 0.10.0, a release with major changes under the hood that will
make IPFS Cluster perform significantly faster with large pinsets and less
memory demanding.

For those upgrading, this release is a mandatory step before any future
upgrades, as it will upgrade the internal state to a new format which prepares
the floor for the upcoming addition of an alternative CRDT-based "consensus"
component. The new component will increase IPFS Cluster scalability orders of
magnitude and unlock collaborative Cluster where random invididuals can
collaborate in replicating content.

We also have a few new features:

* Path resolving before pinning and unpinning
* Ability to manually specify pin allocations
* Environment variable override to all configuration options
* Added the possiblity to store custom metadata with all pins

Finally, the Cluster team would like to thank
[@alekswn](https://github.com/alekswn) and
[@roignpar](https://github.com/roignpar) for their awesome contributions!

Be sure to check the
[changelog](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for
a detailed overview of changes and **upgrade notices**.

Happy pinning!
