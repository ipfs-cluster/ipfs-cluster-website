## 20191001 | Release 0.11.0

A few days ago we shipped IPFS Cluster 0.11.0. This was a huge leap forward as
it finally crystalizes the journey to replace Raft with a system that allows
peers to come and go freely from a cluster while keeping consistency
guarantees on the shared pinset. The effort to find a suitable replacement
started almost a year ago and resulted in a new `crdt` component that is based
on [go-ds-crdt](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-crdt), a datastore
implementation using
[Merkle-CRDTs](https://hector.link/presentations/merkle-crdts/merkle-crdts.pdf).

As mentioned in the
[changelog](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md),
version 0.11.0 is the biggest release in the project's history and it comes with
many other features and improvements.

We have also started running IPFS Cluster workshops on several conferences. We
keep an updated list of past and upcoming events at our
[workshops repository](https://github.com/ipfs-cluster/workshops). In these
workshops, participants install and run cluster peers with a IPFS-hosted
configuration and they automatically discover each other, form a Cluster
and try out all commands.

During the upcoming months we will be shipping more features but also start
taking advantage of IPFS Cluster's new features by launching public
collaborative clusters: we will publish instructions for anyone to join
specific clusters to backup pieces of important IPFS data such as the
distributions page, wikipedia mirrors or community websites.

We wish you a lot of success using the latest version of IPFS Cluster.
