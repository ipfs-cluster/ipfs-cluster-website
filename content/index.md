# Pinset orchestration for IPFS

The IPFS Cluster project aims to facilitate adoption of IPFS by:

* Providing support for production deployments of IPFS in the datacenter
* Facilitating the conservation and replication of data (pinsets) across multiple nodes
* Supporting the handling of large volumes, where a full DAG does not fit in a single IPFS node
* Enabling collaborative storage efforts to backup data of interest on top of IPFS

This website is the central point of access for all IPFS Cluster information, documentation, news and roadmap updates.
