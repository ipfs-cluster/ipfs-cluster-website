# Documentation

<div class="tipbox tip">Updated to version <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-cluster/ipfs-cluster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">1.0.8 (see the Changelog)</a>.</div>

Welcome to IPFS Cluster documentation. The different sections of the documentation will explain how to setup, start, and operate a Cluster. Operating a production IPFS Cluster can be a daunting task if you are not familiar with concepts around [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and peer-2-peer networking ([libp2p](https://libp2p.io) in particular). We aim to provide comprehensive documentation and guides but we are always open for improvements: documentation issues can be submitted to the [ipfs-cluster-website repository](https://github.com/ipfs-cluster/ipfs-cluster-website).

If you need help, head over to the [Support section](/support).
