# Download and installation

In order to run an IPFS Cluster peer and perform actions on the Cluster, you will need to obtain the `ipfs-cluster-service` and `ipfs-cluster-ctl` binaries. The former runs the Cluster peer. The latter allows to interact with it:

* Visit the [download page](/download) for instructions on the different ways to obtain `ipfs-cluster-service` and `ipfs-cluster-ctl`.
* Place the binaries in a place where they can be run by an unattended by an `ipfs` system user (usually `/usr/local/bin`). IPFS Cluster should be installed and run along `ipfs` (go-ipfs).
* Consider configuring your systems to start `ipfs` and `ipfs-cluster-service` automatically (beware to check that you need to ensure your cluster is fully operational and peers discover each other beforehand). Some sample Systemd service files are available here: [ipfs-cluster-service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hsanjuan/ansible-ipfs-cluster/master/roles/ipfs-cluster/templates/etc/systemd/system/ipfs-cluster.service), [ipfs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hsanjuan/ansible-ipfs-cluster/master/roles/ipfs/templates/etc/systemd/system/ipfs.service).


# Initialization

To create and generate a default configuration file, a unique identity for your peer and an empty peerstore file, run:

```
$ ipfs-cluster-service init --consensus <crdt/raft>
```

This assumes that the `ipfs-cluster-service` command is installed in one of the folders in your `$PATH`.

If all went well, after running this command there will be three different files in `$HOME/.ipfs-cluster`:

* `service.json` contains a default peer configuration. Usually, **all peers in a Cluster should have exactly the same configuration**.
* `identity.json` contains the peer private key and ID. These are unique to each Cluster peer.
* `peerstore` is an empty file used to store the peer addresses of other peers so that this peer knows where to contact them.

The `--consensus` flag chooses whether to initialize the configuration with a `raft` or a `crdt` section. All peers should be initialized in the same way. The choice between `raft` and `crdt` depends on multiple factors and affects how the cluster is started and the peerset modified. We have gathered more in-depth explanations in the [Consensus Components](/documentation/guides/consensus) section.

The new `service.json` file generated by `ipfs-cluster-service init` will have a randomly generated `secret` value in the `cluster` section. For a Cluster to work, this value **should be the same in all cluster peers**. This is usually a source of pitfalls since initializing default configurations everywhere results in different random secrets.

<div class="tipbox tip">If present, the <code>CLUSTER_SECRET</code> environment value is used when running <code>ipfs-cluster-service init</code> to set the cluster <code>secret</code> value.</div>

## Remote configuration

`ipfs-cluster-service` can be initialized to use a remote configuration file accessible on an HTTP(s) location which is read to obtain the running configuration every time the peer is launched. This is useful to initialize all peers with the same configuration and provide seamless upgrades to it.

A good trick is to use IPFS to store the actual configuration and, for example, call `init` with a gateway url as follows:

```shell
$ ipfs-cluster-service init http://localhost:8080/ipns/config.mydomain.com
```

(a [DNSLink TXT record](https://dnslink.io/) needs to be configured for the example above to work. A regular URL can be used too).

<div class="tipbox warning">Do not host configurations publicly unless it is OK to expose the Cluster secret. This is only OK in crdt-based clusters which have configured <code>trusted_peers</code> to other than <code>*</code>.</div>


# Trusted peers

The `crdt` section of the `service.json` file includes a single `*` value for the `trusted_peers` array. By default, **peers running on crdt-mode trusts all other peers**. In `raft` mode, all peers trust all other peers and this option does not exist.

Read more about trusted peers in the [Security and Ports guide](/documentation/guides/security).


# The peerstore file

The `peerstore` file will be maintained by the running Cluster peer and will be used to store known-peer addresses. However, you can also pre-fill this file (one line per multiaddress) to help this peer connect to others during its first start. Here is an example:

```text
/dns4/cluster1.domain/tcp/9096/ipfs/QmcQ5XvrSQ4DouNkQyQtEoLczbMr6D9bSenGy6WQUCQUBt
/dns4/cluster2.domain/tcp/9096/ipfs/QmdFBMf9HMDH3eCWrc1U11YCPenC3Uvy9mZQ2BedTyKTDf
/ip4/192.168.1.10/tcp/9096/ipfs/QmSGCzHkz8gC9fNndMtaCZdf9RFtwtbTEEsGo4zkVfcykD
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `peer_addresses` configuration value to provide addresses for other peers.

# Ports

By default, Cluster uses:

* `9096/tcp` as the cluster swarm endpoint which should be open and diallable by other cluster peers.
* `9094/tcp` as the HTTP API endpoint
* `9095/tcp` as the Proxy API endpoint

A full description of the ports and endpoints is available in the [Security guide](/documentation/guides/security).

# Settings for production

The default IPFS and Cluster settings are conservative and work for most setups out of the box. There are however, a number of options that can be optimized with regards to:

* Large pinsets
* Large number of peers
* Networks with very high or lower latencies

Additionally to the settings mentioned here, the [configuration reference](/documentation/reference/configuration) contains detailed information for every configuration section, with extended descriptions of what each value means.

## IPFS Configuration

IPFS deamons can be optimized for production. The options are documented in the official repository:

* [`config` documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md)
* [Experimental features documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md)

### Server profile for cloud deployments

Initialize ipfs using the `server` profile: `ipfs init --profile=server` or `ipfs config profile apply server` if the configuration already exists.

Pay attention to [`AddrFilters`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarm) and [`NoAnnounce`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#addresses) options. They should be pre-filled to sensible values with the `server` configuration profile, but depending on the type of network you are running on, you may want to modify them.

### Datastore settings

For very large repos, consider enabling the Badger datastore. You can convert between datastores using `ipfs-ds-convert` ([instructions](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#basic-usage-2)). Badger should be significantly faster for very large pinsets, at the expense of memory.

Increase `Datastore.BloomFilterSize` according to your repo size (in bytes): `1048576` (1MB) is a good value (more info [here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#datastore))

Do not forget to set `Datastore.StorageMax` to a value according to the disk you want to dedicate for the ipfs repo. This will affect how cluster calculates how much free space there is in every peer.

### Connection manager settings

Increase the `Swarm.ConnMgr.HighWater` (maximum number of connections) and reduce `GracePeriod` to `20s`. It can be as high as your machine would take (`10000` is a good value for large machines). Adjust `Swarm.ConnMgr.LowWater` to about a 25% of the HighWater value.

### File descriptor limit

The `IPFS_FD_MAX` environment variable controls the FD `ulimit` value that `go-ipfs` sets for itself. Depending on your `Highwater` value, you may want to increase it to `8192` or more.


### Garbage collection

We recommend to keep automatic garbage collection on IPFS disabled when using IPFS Cluster to add content as the GC process may delete content as it is being added. Alternatively, it is possible to add content directly to IPFS (this will lock the GC process in the mean time), and only use the Cluster to pin it once added.

## IPFS Cluster configuration

The `service.json` configuration file contains a few options which should be tweaked according to your environment, capacity and requirements.

### `cluster` section 

When dealing with large amount of pins, you may further increase the `cluster.pin_recover_interval`. This operation will perform checks for every pin in the pinset and will trigger `ipfs pin ls --type=recursive` calls, which may be slow when the number of pinned items is huge.

Consider increasing the `cluster.monitor_ping_interval` and `monitor.*.check_interval`. This dictactes how long cluster takes to realize a peer is not responding (and potentially trigger re-pins). Re-pinning might be a very expensive in your cluster. Thus, you may want to set this a bit high (several minutes). You can use same value for both.

Under the same consideration, you might want to set `cluster.disable_repinning` to `true` if you don't wish repinnings to be triggered at all on peer downtime and want to handle things manually when content becomes underpinned. `replication_factor_max` and `replication_factor_min` allow some leeway: i.e. a 2/3 will allow one peer to be down without re-allocating the content assigned to it somewhere else.

### `raft` section

These options only apply when running raft-based clusters.

If you are planning to re-start all Raft peers at the same time (for example, after an upgrade), consider setting `raft.wait_for_leader_timeout` to something that gives ample time for all your peers to be restarted and come online at once. Usually `30s` or `1m`.

If your network is very unstable, you can try increasing `raft.commit_retries`, `raft.commit_retry_delay`. Note: more retries and higher delays imply slower failures.

For high-latency clusters (like having peers around the world), you can try increasing `heartbeat_timeout`, `election_timeout`, `commit_timeout` and `leader_lease_timeout`, although defaults are quite big already. For low-latency clusters, these can all be decreased (at least by half).

For very large pinsets, increase `raft.snapshot_interval`. If your cluster pins or unpins very frequently, increase `raft.snapshot_threshold`.

### `crdt` section

These options only apply when running crdt-based clusters.

Reducing the `crdt.rebroadcast_interval` (default `1m`) to a few seconds should make new peers start downloading the state faster, and badly connected peers should have more options to receive bits of information, at the expense of increased pubsub chatter in the network.

You can edit the `crdt.cluster_name`, as long as it is the same for all peers.

### `restapi` section

Adjust the `api.restapi` network timeouts depending on your API usage. This may protect against misuse of the API or DDoS attacks. Note that there are usually client-side timeouts that can be modified too if you control the clients.

The API can be disabled by removing the configuration section.

### `ipfshttp` section

Adjust the `ipfs_connector.ipfshttp` network timeouts if you are using the ipfs proxy in the same fashion as the `restapi`.

The Proxy API can be disabled by removing the configuration section.
