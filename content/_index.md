# Pinset orchestration for IPFS

The IPFS Cluster project aims to facilitate adoption of IPFS by:

* Providing support for production deployments of IPFS in the datacenter
* Facilitating the conservation and replication of data (pinsets) across multiple nodes
* Supporting the handling of large volumes, where a full DAG does not fit in a single IPFS node
* Enabling collaborative storage efforts to backup data of interest on top of IPFS

This website is the central point of access for all IPFS Cluster information, [documentation](/documentation), [news](/news) and [roadmap](/documentation/overview/roadmap) updates.
